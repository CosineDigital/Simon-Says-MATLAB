# Simon-Says-MATLAB
- A MATLAB app that interfaces with an arduino microcontroller to create a game of Simon Says.
- Written using MATLAB, user-defined functions, and event based programming.
- Contains a robust user interface that keeps the user engaged and informed while playing.

## How it works
- After the user presses start, MATLAB generates a random sequence of numbers that correspond to LEDs on the arduino board.
- Then the sequence is played on the lights and audio for each round.
- The user must enter the same sequence using buttons on the MATLAB app.
- If the user can enter the correct sequence for all rounds, a victory sequence is played. Otherwise, a defeat theme is played.

## Notes
- The .mlapp file is the raw MATLAB app file. You must download it and open it within MATLAB to view and run it.
- Alternatively, you can open the .txt file to view the code.
